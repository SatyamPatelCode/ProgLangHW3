Description:
This code parses natural language commands into a structured query format and then applies these queries to a Prolog knowledge base (facts.pl). 
Using a DCG grammar, it recognizes commands that resemble SQL queries and supports operations like joins, matches, and where conditions.
After parsing, it filters the data according to the queryâ€™s criteria and outputs the results in a tabular format.

Function:
- Parses input commands (e.g., "Get all from employee") into an internal query representation.
- Evaluates queries against provided facts to filter and return matching rows.
- Handles conditions such as `is less than`, `is greater than`, and `equals` for both numeric, string, and date values.
- Prints the filtered results as tables.

Comments/Bugs/Self-Assessment:
- All basic requirements are met: parsing, evaluating conditions, and printing tables.
- No known bugs at this time.
- The code has been tested with the given example commands and produces expected outputs.
